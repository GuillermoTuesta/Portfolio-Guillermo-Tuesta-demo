# About me
Hi! My name is Guillermo Tuesta Rodriguez, and I'm currently taking a course in Machine learning and AI at IT-Högskolan.
In high school I chose the Technology Program, with a focus on IT during the last 2 years. For my last project in high school, I wrote 
about the pros and cons of Chess AI and Chess Engines. After finishing my project, I had found an interest in AI and joined IT-Högskolan right after high school.
